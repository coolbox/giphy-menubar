## Download Demo
This app currently doesn't have a product API key for Giphy, so it could stop working
at any moment. However, if you're cool with that, you can [download the app from here to take it for a spin](goo.gl/jOrQYicontent_copyCopy short URL
).

## Local setup
### Install stuff
`npm install`

### Start the app
